# the only way i have found to work around this problem is deleting
# ~/.ghcjs, ~/.stack, ~/.local, and (possibly) all .stack-work
# directories and building everything from scratch.  don't change this
# if you don't have to, and if you have to, change it before going to
# sleep so you can build over night!
