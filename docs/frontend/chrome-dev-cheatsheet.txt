## console

### special variables

$0: dom element(s) selected via inspect or left-click in the elements pane.
$$: dom element(s) under a css selector
$x: dom element(s) under a xpath selector


### misc

Pretty-print ImmutableJS data structures in the chrome console:

```javascript
const installDevTools = require('immutable-devtools').default;
const Immutable = require('immutable');
installDevTools(Immutable);
```


## unorganized thoughts

there is a "pause icon" that break-points at any exception.

just editing the source in the browser console doesn't work.  the
changes are ignored, at least in our app.  i didn't investigate why;
it's certainly *supposed* to work.

i should probably download this and fast-forward through it:
