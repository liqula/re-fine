% General view on documents, document history and merging


# The current state of a document

The type variable `d` will denote the *current state* of the document.


## Typical parts of the current state

The current state typically contains the text with markups.


### Current state vs. current working state (side note)

One can make difference between current state and current working state.
The difference is that the current working state contains information -- typically comments on the text -- which
is not relevant when the document is finalised.

This difference is not relevant from the patch theory point of view;
current state means current working state from now on (so it contains the comments too).

(CLARIFICATION: "working state" is probably not a good term, and
should not be used outside of this document.  i think it denotes the
'VDoc' together with its associated 'Contribution's, i.e. comments
(notes, questions, discussions) and edits.  contributions are always
relevant for historical reasons even after releasing a new version, in
the same way that a source code repository is not just the latest
release, or even just the commits, but also the commit messages.
comments differ from edits in that they are associated with specific
versions of the document, while edits constitute and define these
versions.)


# Edits

Edits mean *possible modifications* on a current state.

(CLARIFICATION: "edit" is our technical term for patch, and not
restricted to any specific kind of patches.  it can be merged,
rejected, compounded into a list of larger edits, but it will always
remain an edit.)


## Elementary edits

An edit is a sequence of *elementary edits*.
An elementary edit can be insertion of a character or insertion of a word.

The granularity of elementary edits is only relevant in the merging algorithm.
The merging is completely defined if merging of two elementary edits is defined.
It is easier to define merging in case of smaller elementary edits; whilst more sophisticated merging
needs more complex elementary edits.

The associated data type `EEdit d` will denote the type of elementary edits on documents with type `d`.

The type `Edit d` will denote the type of edits, it is defined as

    type Edit d = [EEdit d]

(CLARIFICATION: for sophisticated compounding of edits, we may need
something like this:

    data (Edit d) = ElementaryEdit (EEdit d) | CompoundedEdit [Edit d]

that allows us to keep track of every compounding of even
non-elementary edit lists, and to compound several times and later
revert any number of those compoundings.)

(QUESTIONS: does granularity affect size of edits?)


## Edits may depend on the current state

The proper type of `EEdit` is not `* -> *` but `(d :: *) -> d -> *` i.e.
the type of edits may depend on the *value* of the current state too:
it is not possible to delete from an empty list, for example.
We simplify the type of `EEdit` to avoid dependent types.


## Typical parts of an edit

An (elementary) edit typically contains insertion and deletion of text and modifying markups.
It may also contain metadata like modification time (when the edit was created).

### Authorisation

In case of multiple users, an edit also contains the id of the user who made the modification.
In this case *allowed editors* may be part of the current state to be
able to restrict the possible edits by user id (because the edits depend on the value of the current state).

(OBJECTION: this probably does not fit into our current authorization
concept.  we already have the type 'MetaInfo' to keep track of
creators and last changers, and we have functions to restrict access.
it may make sense to leave a hole for these things in the version
control modules of our code, but they must not re-introduce competing
solutions for problems we've already solved.)


# History

The *history* of a document is the sequence of edits by which the current state was constructed from the empty document.

The *empty document* is value of type `d` (a type class member).


## Local modifications

*Local modifications* are the edits at the end of the history which are not yet stored in the server side
(no acknowledgement was received from the server).

(OBJECTION: please call them local edits, and do not introduce a new term "modification".)

(QUESTION: we currently create an edit on the server.  the client can
merely *request* creation of an edit.  so i don't think local edits
can exist unless we change our implementation.


## Tags

Tags are history identifiers.
(Tags could have the same representation as histories but that would be inefficient.)


# Merging

By edits one can construct a history tree.
The *merge* operation can join two branches of this tree, thus the history evolves to a DAG.


## Automatic merging

I propose an automatic merging algorithm, similar to the one defined at https://github.com/exFalso/OT/blob/master/Patchable.hs#L64
This works by successive merging of elementary edits.

The algorithm can be tuned by defining the type of elementary edits and the merging of any two of them.
There is a lot of room for tuning.

The automatic merging algorithm may note if any information is lost.

In case of the automatic merging does not give a sufficient result (especially in cases when information is lost),
one can use a merge editor which applies additional edits to correct the automatic merging result.

(COMMENT: it would be awesome (in the literal meaning of the word) if
we could have a lot of cases in which we can prove that no information
is destroyed by the merge, but i'm skeptical.  anyway we need to start
with something very simple here, and focus on making the UI suitable
for average word-users, not experienced git-users.  great automatic
merging heuristics and algorithms will be the next step after that.)
