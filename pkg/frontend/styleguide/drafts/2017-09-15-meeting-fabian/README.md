## missing designs

this is a list of screenshots and the pages in
`../liqula_designs_Juli2017_V2.pdf` they correspond to (if any).

- `_`: no design, but we can make a good guess.
- `?`: need clarification

## agenda

- vpn/gitlab (?)
- missing designs (see above).  is this list accurate?
- do we need the liqula logo?  can we have an svg for this?  or the font css specs?
- roundness of logos
  - do we need non-round logos at all?
  - how do we scale down the images to fit into the radius?  same factor for all of them?  which one?
  - or should the svg be circled to begin with, and not deal with it in scss?
- logos need work.  who does it?  deadline?
- color table:
  - anything missing?
  - should we re-arrange anything?
