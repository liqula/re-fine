# this is the stack.yaml file for running the frontend in ghci.  many
# things won't work (ffi functions are all replaced by 'undefined'
# stubs), but the type checker should be able to help you with less
# lag than ghcjs.
#
# to get going, try this:
#
# stack --stack-yaml=stack-no-js.yaml test --fast
# stack --stack-yaml=stack-no-js.yaml exec -- ghci -isrc -itest -i../common/src -i../prelude/src test/Main.hs
#
# to compile with ghcjs, call `nix-build build.nix`.

resolver: nightly-2017-10-11
# this resolver has ghc-8.2 and does not run into internal errors in
# the type checker as often.
