-- | 'Range' contains a position range representing a 'SelectionState' from draftjs (without the
-- direction), plus some measurements about the window scroll state and size.
--
-- Some thoughts on the applicability of @Range Position@:
--
-- a selection state is only valid wrt. a specific RawContent, as the block keys are used to
-- identify locations in the dom.  this means that if the content changes during edits, the
-- selection state may get outdated.
--
-- when creating comments, the text remains read-only during creation of a comment, so the selection
-- will be valid on submit.  good, no issue here.
--
-- when creating edits, the selection state applies to the previous version, so we're fine, too.
--
-- CAVEAT: we make some further assumptions here about the block keys being stable: *iff* the editor
-- never changes block keys for lines once they have one *and* we never store rawcontent values that
-- are *not* already decorated with block keys by draft, *then* we're good.
