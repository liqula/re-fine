# Re:Fine Frontend

This application is based on react-flux.

## Building

### For running in ghc (not ghcjs)

See comments in stack-no-js.yaml.  This is mostly for type-checking.

### For the first time

1. Install Node.js >= 6.x.x
1. cd pkg/frontend

### Each time

1. npm install (only needed if package.json has changed)
1. stack build
1. make

## Running the tests

1. stack test

## Running the App with Webpack's "watch mode":

1. If any dependencies in package.json were changed: npm install
1. npm start
1. Wait until you see something like "Listening at localhost:9090 proxying to http://localhost:8080"
1. Point your browser at http://localhost:9090
1. Wait until `webpack: bundle is now VALID.` appears (in the shell in which you ran "npm start")
1. Now you can see the application in the browser

The browser window will be refreshed whenever the local JavaScript changes.

NOTE: webpack does not watch *.hs files!  If you change Haskell code,
you need to re-run the commands under section "Each time" above.

## Creating Static Assets to be delivered by the Server

1. If any dependencies in package.json were changed: npm install
1. npm run build
1. Deliver `js-build/` from the backend.
